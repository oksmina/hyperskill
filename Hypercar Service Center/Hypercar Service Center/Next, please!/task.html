<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>When a customer gets to the front of the queue, the operator needs to click the <em>"Process next"</em> button so work can begin. This should happen when one of the mechanics has finished the previous job and is ready to serve the next customer. You can't define the exact time when this will occur in the application, so you need to leave the task to the operator.</p>

<p>When the <em>"Process next"</em> button is pushed, the application selects the next customer according to priority defined by the algorithm:</p>

<ol>
	<li>If there are any customers in the oil change queue, they are served first.</li>
	<li>When the oil change queue is empty, customers in the tire inflation queue are next in line.</li>
	<li>Customers requiring diagnostics are served last.</li>
</ol>

<p>As soon as the operator presses the button, the selected ticket number should be displayed, and the relevant queue's length should be reduced by one. The ticket doesn't need to be saved once this action has been completed â€” its number just needs to be shown on the screen.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>Your final task is to make a <em>POST</em> handler for processing the next ticket. After the request is received, the appropriate ticket should be removed from the queue. The handler should process <em>POST</em> requests at "<em>&lt;base_url&gt;/processing</em>", where <em>&lt;base_url&gt;</em> is the host.</p>

<p>Don't forget that there also needs to be a handler to show information about the next ticket.</p>

<p>You need to create a  <code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;</code> element with the content "<em>Next ticket #&lt;number_of_ticket&gt;</em>" on the page that will be displayed to all customers:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;Next ticket #7&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

<p>If there are no tickets to process, the content of the element should be "<em>Waiting for the next client</em>":</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;Waiting for the next client&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

<p>The page with the next ticket should be available at "<em>&lt;base_url&gt;/next</em>", where <em>&lt;base_url&gt;</em> is the host.</p>

<p><div class="alert alert-warning"> Be cautious: URLs in the <em>urls.py</em> module should not contain slashes at the end. </div></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Example</h2>

<p>Assuming all the mechanics are busy and the situation is as a follows: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Customers with tickets <strong>5</strong> and <strong>8</strong> are waiting in the oil change queue.</li>
	<li>The customer with ticket <strong>4</strong> is waiting for tire inflation.</li>
	<li>The customer with ticket <strong>3</strong> is waiting for diagnostics.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the mechanics finish the current job, and the operator pushes the <em>"Process next" </em>button, the customer screen will display the following information:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">Next ticket #5</code></pre>

<p>The next ticket is <strong>5</strong> because customers requiring oil changes go first. The ticket after <strong>5</strong> will be <strong>8</strong>, followed by <strong>4</strong>, and the last ticket will be <strong>3</strong>.</p>
