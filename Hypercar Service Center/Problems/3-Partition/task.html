  <p>In the described partition procedure, we divide a list into two groups: the first one contains elements smaller or equal to a pivot, the other includes those that are greater than the pivot. In some cases, this approach may lead to the worst-case scenario of the quick sort algorithm, for example, when all elements are equal.</p> 
  <p>To address this limitation, we need to change the way we split a list into groups. The idea is to divide the elements of a list into three groups instead of two: smaller, equal, and greater than a pivot. In this case, recursive calls of quicksort are needed to be performed only for the first and the third group. In particular, the algorithm will efficiently work in the case when all elements of an input list are equal.</p> 
  <p>Your task here is to implement this version of the partition procedure.</p> 
  <p><strong>Input:</strong> a list of integer numbers separated by space.</p> 
  <p><strong>Output: </strong>the first line should contain two numbers separated by spaces: the starting and the ending position (both inclusive) of a range where elements are equal to a pivot. The next line should contain the list after applying the 3-partition procedure. Use the leftmost element of the list as a pivot.</p> 
  <p><strong>NOTE: </strong>the output of your algorithm does NOT need to be properly sorted. You should simply provide the first partition according to the provided procedure.</p>
