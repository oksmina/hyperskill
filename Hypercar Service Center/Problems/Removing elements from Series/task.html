<h2>Removing elements from Series</h2>
<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>Imagine you have a Series <code class="java">olympics</code> that stores the names of the cities of the Summer Olympics between 2000 and 2020. The index is set to the year of the games (as an integer), and the city names are represented as strings. Here is a fragment of the Series:</p> 
  <pre>2000            Sydney
2004            Athens
...
2020             Tokyo
dtype: object</pre> 
  <p>However, the games of 2020 were cancelled because of the COVID-19 outbreak.</p> 
  <p>Define a function that removes the corresponding row from the <code class="java">olympics</code> Series and returns the resulting Series object.</p>
