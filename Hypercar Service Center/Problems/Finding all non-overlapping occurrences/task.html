  <p>Modify the described algorithm in such way that it finds the indexes of all non-overlapping occurrences of a pattern in a text.</p> 
  <p><strong>Input:</strong> two lines, the first of which represents the text, the other is the pattern.</p> 
  <p><strong>Output:</strong> the indexes of all non-overlapping occurrences of the pattern in the text or $-1$ if no occurrences are found. For two overlapping substrings, consider the one with the least index as an occurrence. See the test example for details.</p>
