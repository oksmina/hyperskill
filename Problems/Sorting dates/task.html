  <p>John works as a historian. He likes to collect notes about different historical events. Unfortunately, John usually makes his notes inconsequently. Help John to write a program that reorders his notes in the consistent order.</p> 
  <p><strong>Input:</strong> one line containing dates separated by space. The date is represented by an integer number.</p> 
  <p><strong>Output:</strong> the given dates sorting in descending order.</p> 
  <p>Modify the described version of the quick sort algorithm to solve the problem. Apply the <strong>3-partition scheme</strong>. The idea of this approach is to divide the elements of a list into three groups instead of two: smaller, equal, and greater than the pivot. In this case, recursive calls of quicksort are needed to be performed only for the first and the third group. In particular, the algorithm works efficiently in the case when all elements of the input list are equal.</p>
