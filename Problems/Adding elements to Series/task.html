 <body>
  <p>Imagine you have a Series <code class="java">olympics</code> that stores the names of the cities of the Summer Olympics between 2000 and 2016. The index is set to the year of the games (as an integer), and the city names are represented as strings. Here is a fragment of the Series:</p> 
  <pre>2000            Sydney
2004            Athens
...
2016            Rio de Janeiro
dtype: object</pre> 
  <p>The next games will take place in Tokyo (2021), Paris (2024) and Los Angeles (2028).</p> 
  <p>Define a function that adds these three records to the <code class="java">olympics</code> Series and returns the resulting Series object.</p>
